# Dispatch Dev Tools

A collection of helpful development tools. If meteor [refactors](https://meteor.hackpad.com/Proposal-queues-based-build-tool-kbqhWoYYfKR)
 their build tool we can hopefully plug these into it.

## Setup your environment

`npm install git@github.com:DispatchMe/dev-tools.git`

## Run the tools

`dispatch`

This will load private packages defined in `.meteor/git-packages.json` into `.packages` and symlink them into `/packages`.
